# RogerBot

RogerBot is an ominiscient and omnipotent robot that talks and acts just like Roger!
Just kidding!

RogerBot is a conversational bot that learns how to recognize the user's speech and categorizes into different intents (what the user wants to do) and entities (certain keywords) and finds the appropriate response with Javascript. 

The recognization of user speech is powered by a machine learning cloud service created by Microsoft called LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligent Service) and it is trained to understand phrases by giving it utterances and assigning them to the correct intent.

Check out my Javascript on GitHub if you want to learn more about it! The user interface is hosted on my undergrad school server http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~rgeng/.
